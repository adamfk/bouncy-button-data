## Do I need to solder wires to my switch?
Alligator clips are fine if you are doing regular testing and your switch is bouncing less than 20ms.

Why the limit of 20ms? If alligator clips are involved and there is significant bounce in the switch, people may attribute the long bounce data to alligator clip movement (which could definitely be the cause).
You can get around this by securing the switch in place so that the alligator clips aren't moving.

If you want to do advanced testing like fast activations or smack tests though, you really do need a very solid connection (soldered, screw, or secure crimp).
