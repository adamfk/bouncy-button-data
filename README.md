## TLDR - Show Me Some Data!
Every button tested gets its own [issue](https://github.com/adamfk/bouncy-button-data/issues) in this repo. Feel free to explore and add your own data.

## Why Is The Data In Issues?
I chose to use issues because it's a simple way to keep track of the data and it's easy to search and filter. It also allows anyone to easily add their data without needing to go through a pull request.

## We Need You (and your buttons)!
If 1% of the people reading this upload a single test report, we could build an incredible database of real high fidelity button bounce behavior.

It's really easy. All you need is a button and an Arduino Uno/Nano.
