# Bouncy Button Data
Did you read [Jack Ganssle's excellent guide to debouncing](https://www.ganssle.com/debouncing.htm) and wish you had access to all of his data in high definition where you could view/analyze it to your hearts' content?

I love his work, but the images are very low resolution, pixelated and fuel my need for more & better data!!!

## We Need You (and your buttons)!
If 1% of the people reading this upload a single test report, we could build an incredible database of real high fidelity button bounce behavior.

It's really easy. All you need is a button and an Arduino Uno/Nano.
