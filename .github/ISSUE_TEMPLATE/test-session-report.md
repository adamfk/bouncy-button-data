Please attach the Arduino serial monitor output as a text file.

It would be really helpful if you could post a screenshot of some of the graphs and/or [attach a pdf](https://github.com/adamfk/bouncy-button-data/wiki/creating-a-pdf-of-your-data). This takes a bit more effort, but will help make this repo much more interesting for people to browse.

If you'd like to, feel free to include additional highlights or observations from your test session. It's always interesting to read about.
