Thanks for sharing your button/switch data with the community.

Please note: 
- This issue is for a **particular instance** of a switch/button of the original poster. If someone else wants to test the same switch model, they should create a new issue.
- The original poster can add additional test sessions to this issue (if they wish) by adding a comment.

# Test Session 1

## Setup
<!-- Please fill out the following information about your test setup: -->

Property                                      | Description
----------------------------------- | -----------------------------------------------------
Arduino model                            | TODO: Uno, Nano, ...
Pull-up resistor                            | TODO: Arduino internal (default - bonus if you measure!), external, none
Switch wires connection              | TODO: soldered, alligator clips, screws...
Measure switch's ON resistance | TODO: Rough measurement is fine like 0.5 ohms
Anything else connected?           | TODO: oscilloscope?

**Test Setup Photos:**
Please upload picture(s) of your test setup showing how the switch is connected to your Arduino. Please be wary of insecure wires/connections as they can cause many signal glitches.
