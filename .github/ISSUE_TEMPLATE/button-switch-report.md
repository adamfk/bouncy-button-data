Thanks for sharing your button/switch data with the community.

Please note: 
- This issue is for a **particular instance** of a switch/button of the original poster. If someone else wants to test the same switch model, they should create a new issue.
- The original poster can add additional test sessions to this issue (if they wish) by adding a comment.

# Switch Info
Please fill out the following information about the switch you are testing:

- Type: toggle, push button, tactile, slide, rocker, limit, dip, stomp, other
- Circuit: SPST, SPDT, ...
- Resting state: normally closed, normally open
- How new is the switch? barely used, moderately used, heavily used, unknown
- Model info: if available
- Product URL: if available. please consider using https://web.archive.org/save to preserve page for future button enthusiasts
- Current rating: if available
- Anything else noteworthy? Any interesting history?

# Test Session #1

## Setup
Please fill out the following information about your test setup:
- Pull-up resistor: Arduino internal (this is the default), external (please specify value), none
    - Bonus points for measuring the actual pull-up resistor value. See how-to guide.
- Arduino model: Uno, Nano, ...
- Measure switch's ON resistance: bonus points!
- Anything else connected? oscilloscope?
- Anything else noteworthy?

Please upload picture(s) of your test setup showing how the switch is connected to your Arduino. Please be wary of insecure wires/connections as they can cause many signal glitches.
