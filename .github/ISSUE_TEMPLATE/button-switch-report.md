Thanks for sharing your button/switch data with the community.

Please note: 
- This issue is for a **particular instance** of a switch/button of the original poster. If someone else wants to test the same switch model, they should create a new issue.
- The original poster can add additional test sessions to this issue (if they wish) by adding a comment.

# Switch Info
Please fill out the following information about the switch you are testing:

- Type: toggle, push button, tactile, slide, rocker, limit, dip, stomp, other
- Circuit: SPST, SPDT, ...
- Function: Off-On (rocker/toggle), Off-Mom (Normally Open), ...
- How new is the switch? barely used, moderately used, heavily used, unknown
- Model info/markings: if available
- Product URL: if available. please consider using https://web.archive.org/save to preserve page for future button enthusiasts
- Voltage & Current rating: if available
- How do you like the switch: 
- Anything else noteworthy: Any interesting history?

# Test Session 1

## Setup
Please fill out the following information about your test setup:
- Pull-up resistor: Arduino internal (this is the default), external (please specify value), none
    - Bonus points for measuring the actual pull-up resistor value. See how-to guide.
- Switch wires connection: soldered, alligator clips, screws...
- Arduino model: Uno, Nano, ...
- Measure switch's ON resistance: bonus points! Rough measurement is fine like 0.5 ohms.
- Anything else connected: oscilloscope?
- Anything else noteworthy: test section descriptions?

Please upload picture(s) of your test setup showing how the switch is connected to your Arduino. Please be wary of insecure wires/connections as they can cause many signal glitches.
