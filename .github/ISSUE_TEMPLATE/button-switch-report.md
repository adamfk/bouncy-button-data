Thanks for sharing your button/switch data with the community.

Please note: 
- This issue is for a **particular instance** of a switch/button of the original poster. If someone else wants to test the same switch model, they should create a new issue.
- The original poster can add additional test sessions to this issue (if they wish) by adding a comment.

# Test Session 1

## Setup
Please fill out the following information about your test setup:
- Pull-up resistor: Arduino internal (this is the default), external (please specify value), none
    - Bonus points for measuring the actual pull-up resistor value. See how-to guide.
- Switch wires connection: soldered, alligator clips, screws...
- Arduino model: Uno, Nano, ...
- Measure switch's ON resistance: bonus points! Don't worry about < 1 ohm.
- Anything else connected? oscilloscope?
- Anything else noteworthy?

Please upload picture(s) of your test setup showing how the switch is connected to your Arduino. Please be wary of insecure wires/connections as they can cause many signal glitches.
